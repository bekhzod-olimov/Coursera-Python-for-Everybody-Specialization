# Python for Everybody Specialization by University of Michigan

This repository contains my solutions to all the materials, namely quizes and programming assignments of the [Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python?) specialization courses conducted by prof. Charles Russel Severance. Anyone can freely use the contents of the repository. Since I uploaded the materials to GitHub later, there were several problems in uploading the materials of the course #5 related to course period expiration. Please, contact me if you have further questions related to the contents.
